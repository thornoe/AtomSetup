# Atom setup notes
[Atom](https://atom.io/) (developed by GitHub) is a great solution for handling program languages like LaTeX, Markdown, Python, and R in a single text editor with a smooth user interface.

However, it requires quite some setup (see below), fine-tuning, trouble-shooting and practice before you are able to enjoy its full functionality. Thus, before comitting make sure that Atom is the right choice for your needs by reading a few comparisons with other alternatives, e.g.
1.   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is the oldest and most common of the text editors but has poor word-suggestions and updates are infrequent due to not being open source
2.   [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) by Microsoft. One of many pros is that it allows you to edit Jupyter Notebooks outside of your browser

Compared to the two above, Atom can have slower performance but offers the best functionality with GitHub when collaborating on a project.

## General installation of Atom:
-   Follow the installation guide <https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/>
-   To install Atom packages either
    1. Press `ctrl+,` in Atom and search for packages under 'install'
    2. Or open the terminal (e.g. Command Prompt in Windows) and run a command like `apm install file-icons`. The first time run `apm` to check apm is installed correctly
-   The choice of UI Theme and Syntax Theme is highly subjective. I find [seti-ui](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui) and [seti-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/seti-syntax) very pleasant

## LaTeX
-   [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) works with atom-latex, MiKTeX does not
-   Always install the following Atom packages, e.g. by running the command in terminal:
    ```
    apm install atom-latex language-latex pdf-view
    ```
-   Check the [optional packages listed by Benjamin Gray](https://gist.github.com/Aerijo/5b9522530715e5be6e89fc012e9a72a8) (ignore the Linter-packages and see 'Ide' below instead)

## Markdown
-   Install the two packages `markdown-writer language-markdown`
-   `markdown-preview` is pre-installed. Press `ctrl+shift+m` to toogle on/off
-   If you're new to Markdown language, check this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Python
-   Python is installed by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) (choose 'Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable'), and running it through the [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen) package in Atom by marking a snippet of code and pressing `ctrl+enter`
    -   In the terminal run `apm install hydrogen hydrogen-launcher script`
-   All you need is the [Script](https://atom.io/packages/script) package, but consider optional packages from the [list at pythonmania](https://www.pythonmania.net/en/2017/02/27/recommended-atom-packages) (ignore `linter-pydocstyle` & `flake8` but see IDE below instead)
-   Install the [Python Language Server](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server#python-language-server) (pyls) by running `python -m pip install python-language-server[all]` in the terminal (alternatively, try `python -m pip install 'python-language-server[all]'`
-   Update Python once in a while by running `conda update --all` and `pip_upgrade_outdated` (install the [hack](https://pypi.org/project/pip-upgrade-outdated/) first: `pip install pip_upgrade_outdated`)

## R
-   Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [IRkernel](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/#binary-panel), (and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/))
-   You can run R in atom through Hydrogen just as descriped for Python above.
-   Setup according to the [guide by Jeff Stafford](https://jstaf.github.io/2018/03/25/atom-ide.html)
-   OBS: The `atom-ide-ui` terminal replaces Linter (i.e. see the Ide not the Linter part below)

## Spell-check
Pre-installed Spell-check package
-   Add `text.tex.latex, text.tex.latex.beamer, text.md` to "Grammars"
    - To find out what scope to add for a current file: put the cursor in the file, open the Command Palette `ctrl-shift-p`, and search for the `Editor: Log Cursor Scope` command.
-   Add the following line to "Excluded Scopes":
    - `markup.underline.link.gfm, Support.function.tex, support.function.latex, meta.preamble.latex, support.type.function.latex, comment.line.percentage.tex, storage.type.function.latex, string.other.math.tex, string.other.math.block.environment.latex, variable.parameter.function.latex, constant.other.reference.latex`
-   Add `en-US`, `da-DK`, `es-ES` or others under 'Locales' (check the 'Use Locales' box)
-   Windows Language (equivalently for Linux):
    - For now you need to set the system language to `English (United States)` for spell-check to work.
    - When a certain bug fix is approved you'll only need to make sure that `English (United States)` is installed in Windows language settings.
-   Place the cursor at a highlighted word and press `ctrl+shift+:` to run spell-check

## IDE
Used for language support instead of Linter due to better functionality with Python and R. Install atom-ide-ui and those of the following Atom packages that you need: `pip install atom-ide-ui ide-python ide-r atom-ide-debugger-python platformio-ide-terminal`
-   [atom-ide-ui](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui) (Under 'Settings' > 'Enabled Features' I choose to disable 'Console', 'Debugger', 'atom-ide-refactor', and 'Terminal')
-   [ide-python](https://atom.io/packages/ide-python) for Python language support.
    - I add the [error codes](http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes) `E2, E3, E501, W2, W3, W5` under 'Settings' > 'PyCodeStyle' > 'Ignore'
    - Automatically changes tab-length to 4 spaces for all .py files (overwrites global Atom settings which you can still set to e.g. 2 for LaTeX and other languages.)
-   [ide-r](https://atom.io/packages/ide-r) for R language support.
-   [atom-ide-debugger-python](https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-debugger-python) (optional debugger for Python code)
-   [platformio-ide-terminal](https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal) (optional package that adds a terminal in the bottom of Atom editor)

## Linter
Common package for language support but suboptimal for Python and R, thus, I recommend using IDE instead
-   However, if you prefer [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) (e.g. if you only use Atom for LaTeX and Markdown) you can install the package `linter` and the relevant [language specific linter packages](https://atomlinter.github.io/), e.g.
    - `linter-markdown`
    - `linter-ui-default` & `linter-chktex` for LaTeX
    - `linter-pydocstyle` & `flake8` for Python (Ignore Error Codes: D100, E266, E305, W391 in flake8)
